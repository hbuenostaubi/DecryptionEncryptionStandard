## Simple DES Simulation with Python

The python script shows the process of a [Simple Decryption Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard) block cypher with a python script. Additionally, it gives you a recursive permutation of all the bit keys that could be created below the original script. As the key is only ten bits, all the possible permuations of the key could be tested and compared to the cypher text by running the algorithm key and comparing the cypher texts via brute force. This is why DES is now depricated and the AES standard was created for encryption/decryption.
